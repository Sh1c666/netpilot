# NetPilot — single-image build.
# Stage 1 compiles the React/Vite SPA; stage 2 assembles the Python backend and
# drops the built SPA where FastAPI serves it (/). Result: one container, one
# process, open http://localhost:8000.

# ---------- Stage 1: build the frontend -------------------------------------
FROM node:20-alpine AS frontend
WORKDIR /build

# Deps first (cached unless package*.json change).
COPY frontend/package.json frontend/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Build → /build/dist (tsc -b && vite build).
COPY frontend/ ./
RUN npm run build

# ---------- Stage 2: backend runtime ----------------------------------------
FROM python:3.12-slim AS runtime
